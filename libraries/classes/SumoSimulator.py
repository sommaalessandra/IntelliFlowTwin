# ****************************************************
# Module Purpose:
#   This library defines the Simulator class, which is responsible for interacting with the sumoenv Simulator.
#   The Simulator class manages the running of the simulation, from its start to its completion.
#
#   It provides various methods for controlling the simulation, gathering data on vehicles, induction loops,
#   and managing traffic lights using the libtraci library for communication with the sumoenv Simulator and the
#   running simulation inside it.
#
# ****************************************************

# These libraries are quite the same. They include most of the commands available in the traci library, but the
# time performance better. Libtraci addresses some limitation of the libsumo library, in particular the multiple client
# communication with the simulation.
